Advanced XP Bar
==================
Have you ever wondered if you have completed enough quests to level up? Wonder no more! This addon notifies you when you have enough completed quests to level up. Your experience bar will show a green color indicating the amount of experience you have waiting for you once you deliver your completed quests. You will also be notified with sound and a banner on top of your screen!
